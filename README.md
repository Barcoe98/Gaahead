As Part of a Third year assignment we were tasked with creating an app using android studio and developed using kotlin. 
I chose to design and develope a club management app, 
where you can manage the club u are managing or as a player yopu can view you stats and results fixtures etc

# App Walkthrough

## Fixture Fragments
Fixture Fragments are used for a user to create a fixture of a upcoming match , which is displayed to all users. Fixture Fragments have crud functionality, They are displayed on a recycler view, if you swipe left or right it will delete or edit the fixture. Fixture All Fragments display all users fixtures. Favourites fixtures shows the Fixture the user has Bookmarked on a separate view

## Players Fragments
Player Fragments are used for a manger to store details about each player in his team. Again, like Fixtures and results, Player has crud functionality. These are displayed on a recycler view and can we delete or edited by  a swipe left or right. Player All Fragment displays all users Players on a recycler view.

## Results Fragments
Results are used to record a result of a fixture. Result Fragments also have crud Functionality. These are displayed on a recycler view and can we delete or edited by  a swipe left or right. Result All Fragments Display all users result on a view.

## Clubs Fragments
Club Fragments are used to show details of a club .Admin is the only user to be able to add a club or remove one. Club has Basic feature and are displayed o a recycler view. When a club is clicked on a user can View details about the club such as history, year Founded etc. You can also Bookmark a club which is displayed on a separate view where all your bookmarked clubs are.
